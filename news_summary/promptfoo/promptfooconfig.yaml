description: News Summary Evaluation
prompts:
- "Article: {{text}}\nYou will generate increasingly concise, entity-dense summaries\
  \ of the above article. \n\nRepeat the following 2 steps 5 times. \n\nStep 1. Identify\
  \ 1-3 informative entities (\";\" delimited) from the article which are missing\
  \ from the previously generated summary. \nStep 2. Write a new, denser summary of\
  \ identical length which covers every entity and detail from the previous summary\
  \ plus the missing entities. \n\nA missing entity is:\n- relevant to the main story,\
  \ \n- specific yet concise (5 words or fewer), \n- novel (not in the previous summary),\
  \ \n- faithful (present in the article), \n- anywhere (can be located anywhere in\
  \ the article).\n\nGuidelines:\n\n- The first summary should be long (4-5 sentences,\
  \ ~80 words) yet highly non-specific, containing little information beyond the entities\
  \ marked as missing. Use overly verbose language and fillers (e.g., \"this article\
  \ discusses\") to reach ~80 words.\n- Make every word count: rewrite the previous\
  \ summary to improve flow and make space for additional entities.\n- Make space\
  \ with fusion, compression, and removal of uninformative phrases like \"the article\
  \ discusses\".\n- The summaries should become highly dense and concise yet self-contained,\
  \ i.e., easily understood without the article. \n- Missing entities can appear anywhere\
  \ in the new summary.\n- Never drop entities from the previous summary. If space\
  \ cannot be made, add fewer new entities. \n\nRemember, use the exact same number\
  \ of words for each summary.\nAnswer in JSON. The JSON should be a list (length\
  \ 5) of dictionaries whose keys are \"Missing_Entities\" and \"Denser_Summary\"\
