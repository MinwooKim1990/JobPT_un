However, there is no mention of Kubernetes experience, which is a preferred skill in the JD.\\n\\nOverall Assessment (1-2 points): The resume aligns well with some of the core competencies required for the position, but it lacks specific experience in FastAPI and Kubernetes, which are mentioned in the JD. The resume showcases relevant experience and skills, but it could be more appealing if it included a direct match to all the key requirements mentioned in the JD.'"
