you wanting more. Our passion for food and fun are on display every day, and
we need you to help us win championships! At Walk-On's we value team
camaraderie, and we play for the name on the front not the back.

Our Server position gives team members an opportunity to work in a fast paced,
team-oriented, gameday atmosphere taking care of our guests.

Server opportunities are offered in a part time capacity. Flexible hours and
scheduling are available, which is great for the busy student or anyone who
has outside obligations. Room for advancement on the team is always a
possibility for the right team member!

 **Requirements/Responsibilities**

  * Ability to lift 25 lbs.
  * Ability to stand for 10+ hours
  * Ability to adhere to uniform guidelines
  * Ability to memorize floor chart, table numbers, and steps of service
  * Have reliable form of transportation

Must possess the following qualities:

  * Winning personality
  * Consistent positive attitude
  * Team work mentality
  * Fluent in English

Previous restaurant or customer service experience is not required but is
preferred.

**Position Classification**

The position for which you are being considered is a part-time position,
which, for purposes of the federal health reform law, satisfies federal
standards. Under those federal standards, work is part-time if someone works
29 hours or less a week on average. This average is not calculated on a week-
by-week basis. Instead, a measurement period, also known as a look back
period, is used to determine the average hours an employee works per week.
Work hours may fluctuate from time-to-time depending on business needs and how
hours are scheduled. Simply because hours may increase from time-to-time does
not mean the position ceases to be a part-time position; it does not mean the
position is full-time for benefits or other purposes. Variation in hours is
part of the job position and may be such that you work well over 30 hours per
week for an extended time. All changes to full-time positions will be
documented with a formal notice; in the absence of that designation by us, a
change has not occurred.

Federal law states that an employer is to measure its employees' hours worked
to determine possible future health plan eligibility; therefore, if you are
hired, we will track any hours worked over a 12-month period starting with the
first day of the first month following the date of hire. If, at the end of the
12 months you are then determined to be eligible, you will be offered plan
coverage at that time for the _following_ 12 months. (Coverage is never
available retroactively.)"
