  * Building on top of a cutting-edge custom OLAP database. 
  * Implementing advanced dimensionality reduction techniques

    * Taking ownership of complex problems from day one 
    * Putting in the extra effort to learn new technologies rapidly 
    * Pushing yourself outside your comfort zone regularly 
    * Maintain high standards of code quality despite being new to the industry 
    * Think critically about system and product design rather than just following instructions   

**What Will Set You Apart  
  
**

  * Experience working with GraphQl or a comparable API technology. 
  * Experience working with ML, analytics, data science or data visualization products. 
  * Working knowledge of Machine Learning and/or Data Science. 
  * First-hand experience working with large language models (LLMs) or developing AI products.   
  

The estimated annual salary and variable compensation for this role is between
$100,000 - $135,000, plus a competitive equity package. Actual compensation is
determined based upon a variety of job related factors that may include:
transferable work experience, skill sets, and qualifications. Total
compensation also includes a comprehensive benefit package, including:
medical, dental, vision, 401(k) plan, unlimited paid time off, generous
parental leave plan, and others for mental and wellness support.
